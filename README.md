#  SmileCare – Dental Appointment Web App

A modern, user-friendly dental clinic website designed to help patients understand services, consult their dental needs, and book appointments with confidence.

This project focuses on **clear UX, reduced decision fatigue**, and a **consultation-first approach** rather than overwhelming users with booking options.

##  Design Philosophy

This app intentionally avoids excessive booking buttons.

Instead:

* Users are guided through **consultation first**
* Services explain *what to expect*
* Booking is contextual and purposeful

This reduces cognitive load and improves trust — especially important in healthcare UX.
